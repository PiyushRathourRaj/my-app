Pathfinding Visualizer
Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithm, and I wanted to visualize it in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it.

This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
